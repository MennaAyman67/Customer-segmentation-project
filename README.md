#  Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer demographics and spending behavior to identify distinct customer segments.  
By applying **data preprocessing, visualization, and clustering algorithms (KMeans & DBSCAN)**, we aim to discover patterns in customer behavior that can help businesses design better marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.

##  Dataset Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **CustomerID** | Unique identifier for each customer (used only for reference, not clustering). |
| **Gender** | Customer‚Äôs gender (Male/Female). |
| **Age** | Age of the customer in years. |
| **Annual Income (k$)** | Customer‚Äôs annual income measured in thousand dollars. |
| **Spending Score (1‚Äì100)** | A score assigned by the mall based on customer spending behavior and purchasing patterns. |

##  Project Workflow

### üîπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handle irrelevant features (remove `CustomerID`).  
- Encode categorical features (`Gender`).  
- Apply feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.

### üîπ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution plots of **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**.  
- Boxplots to detect outliers.  
- Correlation heatmap.  

### üîπ Modeling
- **KMeans Clustering**
  - Optimal `k` selected using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**.  
- **DBSCAN Clustering**
  - `eps` chosen using **k-distance graph**.  
  - Identifies dense regions & detects noise points.

### üîπ Visualization
- Elbow curve and silhouette score plots.  
- K-distance graph for DBSCAN.  
- 2D scatter plots of clusters using Plotly (interactive).

##  Results & Insights
- **KMeans** suggested optimal clusters for customer segmentation.  
- **DBSCAN** detected outliers and showed density-based clusters.  
- The segments identified can help in **targeted marketing** such as:  
  - Premium customers (high income, high spending).  
  - Budget-conscious customers (low income, low spending).  
  - Young vs. older demographic groups.  

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
-  Plotly  
- Scikit-learn  

---

##  Future Work
- Try other clustering algorithms (Hierarchical, Gaussian Mixture).  
- Add RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features for advanced segmentation.  
- Deploy results in an interactive dashboard (Streamlit / Plotly Dash).
